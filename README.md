## About

This SDK provides the utility classes, example code, and documentation tools to build a Java REST client for the HHS Media Services API.

## Prerequisites

You must have Java 1.6 or higher installed to build the SDK.

The SDK uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) as its build tool, but you do not need to have Gradle installed. The SDK includes the Gradle wrapper, which contains all the needed dependencies.

## Installation

1. Unzip the SDK distribution

	```unzip syndication-java-sdk-v2-alpha-0.1.zip```

2. Run the following command:

	```./gradlew build```
	
	The previous command compiles the source, execute the example JUnit tests and builds a JAR file that can be use  in your own application. See the next section for further information.
